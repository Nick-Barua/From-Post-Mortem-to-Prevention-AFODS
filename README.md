## 📋 Project Overview
This repository hosts the **Functional Safety (FuSa)** framework for the Advanced Falling Object Detection System (AFODS). While the sensor fusion repository handles the "vision," this repository handles the **logic of prevention**. 

It details the transition from traditional "post-mortem" analysis (learning after an injury) to "real-time prevention" (detecting a fall and reacting before impact).

### 🛡️ Key Features
* **ASIL-D Compliance:** Analysis of safety goals and hazardous event mitigation.
* **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA):** Decomposition of system failures in multi-modal sensor environments.
* **V-Model Integration:** Traceability from Safety Goals to Software Requirements.
